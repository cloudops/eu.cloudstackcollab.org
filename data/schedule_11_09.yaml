As an extremely portable and flexible way to deploy object, block, and file storage, it's an ideal candidate to use as a backing store for virtualisation platforms. In many ways Ceph fits alongside CloudStack like a hand in a glove.  In this talk I will provide a brief introduction to Ceph, and how you can use it to integrate with CloudStack."

  speaker: "Nicolas Vazquez"
  company: "Shapeblue"
  time: "15:40 - 16:25 GMT"
  desc: "Speaker 1: Harikrishna Patnala Speaker 2: Nicolas Vazquez  This talk introduces the recent changes on the Vmware vSphere integration with CloudStack. These changes make the CloudStack vSphere integration more efficient and extend it by introducing many features which were not supported by CloudStack and would be beneficial to the operators of vSphere-based CloudStack clouds. The vSphere integration improves different operations benefiting from the new implementations of the vSphere native AP, for operations such as VM migrations, snapshots, deployment. Apart from the improvements on the existing operations, it now also supports new storage types: vSAN, VMFS6 and VVOLs. Also, it introduces the storage management concepts of Datastore Clusters and Storage Policies into Cloudstack. It also brings support to deploying virtual appliances with a new optional mode of deployment (deploy-as-is) as if they were deployed directly from vSphere, meaning that CloudStack supports different deployment options, configurations, vApp properties, etc; which are parsed from the template OVF file descriptor."

  speaker: "Boris V.Kuznetsov"
  company: "Stealth Mode Startup"
  time: "15:40 - 16:25 GMT"
  desc: "Cloud computing has established itself as a unique paradigm to deliver computing as utility to a wide range of scientific, enterprise, government, industrial and consumer applications.  However, there were much concern in both industry and academia about security, performance, resource and usage monitoring for cloud applications.  CloudStack has a long proven track record, vibrant community and extensive online documentation. However, topics such as security monitoring, resource usage, host metrics, application metrics and IP address allocation in the cloud are still highly under investigated and poorly covered.  In this talk, we consider a typical SMB private cloud use case with Apache CloudStack as a cloud orchestration tool. We are going to show how to set up Prometheus metrics exporter and visualize a critical cloud application metrics with Grafana. We will run a live monitoring for important resources like CPU/RAM/Storage usage, IP pools usage and VM metrics."
