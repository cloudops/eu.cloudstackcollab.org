  time: "14:25 - 15:05 GMT"
  desc: "From telecoms to managed service providers, many companies are seeking to capture market share within the fast growing cloud computing market. One of the largest challenges service providers face is around how to best assemble a portfolio of cloud services that they can deliver, operate and chargeback for through a normalized user interface and APIs. Building on the strong foundations of CloudStack, cloud.ca, a regional Canadian cloud provider has been using CloudMC as their platform for many years to service the cloud needs of over one hundred business customers, spanning multiple industry verticals (ie. public sector, healthcare and life sciences, financial institutions and SaaS companies). This presentation is for service providers who want to assemble, deliver, operate and monetize cloud services leveraging CloudStack, as well as complementary cloud services (ie. bare metal, object storage, hyperscale clouds, kubernetes, etc.) to meet the evolving needs of their business customers."

Live migration between different storages is also not widely supported. In this presentation, we’ll show the capabilities and limitations of the most popular storage types and will present the new options of live storage migration between some of the storage types that are currently under development by our company."

We have already started the development of a ACS Management Portal which is going to be very cost effective and easy for the companies who want's to make entry into Selling Public Cloud using CloudStack. We will be offering it at very optimal cost with very user friendly UI/UX."

  speaker: "Alexandre Mattioli"
  company: "SB"
  time: "15:55 - 16:25 GMT"
  desc: "Network functions virtualization (NFV) is rapidly changing the networking landscape, virtual network functions (VNFs) are replacing classical hardware based network functions and moving the 'brains' of the network from dedicated hardware to virtual machines. The rise of VNFs allows for complex network functions to be deployed to locations previously inaccessible at the edge of networks, allowing for enterprises to control their networks at the border and not only at the core, which is especially important with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical systems (CPSs). VNFs can be used for functions such as routers, load balancers, firewalls, intrusion detection devices (IPS/IDS), WAN accelerators, VPN endpoints, SD-WAN, session border controllers, route reflectors and many others. Apache Cloudstack can be leveraged in order to enable and automate the deployment of VNFs in datacentres and at the edge, ACS can also consume VNFs driven networks by using SD-WAN, WAN optimization and other technologies to create the underlying networking infrastructure on top of which ACS stands."

  speaker: "Sven Vogel (Sponsored)"
  company: "EWERK Group"
  time: "15:55 - 16:25 GMT"
  desc: "System-relevant institutions, especially those that operate critical infrastructures, face a wide range of challenges: Immensely sensitive data, high certification requirements for service providers, and they must be able to fulfill the permanent functioning of IT systems with multiple emergency scenarios. However, their legacy systems are often outdated and the modernization of IT landscapes is much more complex than in the free, non-regulated economy. This is exactly where open source technologies can be a solution to various requirements and challenges. Sven Vogel outlines the problem horizon and shows how cloudstack technology comes into play."
