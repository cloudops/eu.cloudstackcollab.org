  speaker: "Suresh Kumar Anaparti"
  company: "ShapeBlue"
  time: "13:00 - 13:45 GMT"
  desc: "Currently, CloudStack supports various managed storages, such as SolidFire, Ceph, Datera, etc as the primary storages through their respective storage plugins. Dell EMC PowerFlex (previously known as VxFlexOS and ScaleIO), a distributed shared block storage, is one of the unsupported storages. The support for it as a managed primary storage was recently introduced in CloudStack, for KVM hypervisor.  In this talk, Suresh will provide the insights of the PowerFlex storage plugin integration in CloudStack and give a demo of some of the supported VM and Volume operations using the PowerFlex storage pool."

  speaker: "Pearl Dsilva"
  company: "ShapeBlue"
  time: "13:50 - 14:20 GMT"
  desc: "Deployment and management of Kubernetes(K8S) clusters is hard, and managing clusters across different cloud platforms has proven to be an even bigger challenge considering each provider has their own choice of tooling for deploying K8S Clusters. The Kubernetes community saw a need to devise a standardized way to deploy and manage clusters across different infrastructures. Thus, the Kubernetes SIG Cluster Lifecycle created the Cluster API project - which addresses these challenges. It provides a declarative Kubernetes-style pattern to automate cluster deployments. Some of the top cloud providers have extended this model to facilitate consistent and repeatable deployments across infrastructures. With CloudStack adopting this Kubernetes-native style for cluster deployment, one will be able to  provision their clusters with minimal effort and will encourage users to manage Kubernetes workloads in hybrid / multi-cloud environments."

This not only makes CloudStack a more versatile and multifaceted application, but also reduces the gap between virtualization and containerization. As CKS matures, new featues are added to provide a holistic and comprehensive Kubernetes managed service. This session is a feature first of the new functionalities added to CKS which include native support for cluster autoscaling, official support of CloudStack as a provider and others. It consists of walkthroughs, demos as well as business benefits with these new additions."
