  speaker: "Philipp Reisner"
  company: "LINBIT"
  time: "13:55 - 14:25 GTM"
  desc: "LINSTOR is a storage orchestrator for Linux that builds useful storage stacks from the well-established building blocks on Linux: LVM, Software RAID, LUKS/DM-crypt, NVMe-oF Target & Initiator, DRBD, ZFS, VDO, and more.  With that, it provides persistent, high performant storage volumes for virtual machines in a CloudStack cloud. It is known to scales to many hundreds of physical hypervisor nodes. It goes beyond in-data center synchronous replication by providing async replication (continuous snapshot difference shipping) between data centers and backup to S3 storage functionalities.  CloudStack now comes with a Storage Plugin for LINSTOR that seamlessly integrates these two Open-Source gems."

CloudStack supports IPv6 in basic zone and shared networks in Advanced zone. We are working on support IPv6 in isolated networks and VPC networks in advanced zone.  In this talk, we will introduce what we have tested and discussed in mailing list, including the IPv6 routing (static routing, dynamic routing) and IPv6 addressing, and our development plan to support IPv6. We will explain the design and give a demo of IPv6 static routing in isolated networks and VPC. We aim to have the feature in CloudStack future releases."
